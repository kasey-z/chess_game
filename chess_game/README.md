# Chess Game

- This is the project from [the Odin Project' Ruby final project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project).

- This is a command line Chess game. In order to run this game, you will need to install Ruby in your system. CD to the root dir then run $ruby script.rb. You may save the progress at each turn and start the game will the saved file at the beginning.

- Chess is a classic game that appears very complicated at first but can be broken down into logical steps that make it a great Ruby capstone project. If you've never played, be sure to read up on the rules (see the [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess)) first.

- The purpose of the project is to use almost all the knowledge I learn from the Ruby course to build a completed game. The knowledge used as below:

- 1) data serialize

- 2) RSpec testing

- 3) basic concept/ control structures/ collections/ method/ classes

- The things need to improve: keeping the class clean.
